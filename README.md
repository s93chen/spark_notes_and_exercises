  - one of my early exercises in which I tried to understand the following given Toronto Bike Share data (yes those green bikes that you see everywhere):
    1. Top 10 popular trips.
    2. Impact of weather on trips and bike share usage.
    3. Routes for potential new bikelanes.
    4. Predicts the duration of a trip.
